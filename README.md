## Project Goal
The main goal of this project is to showcase the implementation of WebSockets in a chat application, enabling real-time communication between users.

## Key Considerations
- This project focuses on demonstrating the usage of WebSockets within a simple chat application.
- It provides a basic, functional example of how WebSockets can be integrated into a Rails application to handle real-time messaging.

## Technologies and Tools Used
- Ruby version: `2.6.3`
- Rails version: `5.2.3`
- WebSockets (for real-time communication)

## Notes
